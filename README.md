Simple_C_Shell

This program is a very basic shell that implements a few commands such as:

pwd (print working directory)
cd <file path> (changes directory into specified file path)
ls or ls <file name> (lists current directories or directories within specified file name)
grep <substring> <file name> (returns all lines within a file that has specified substring)
./<executable file name> (executes a program)
exit (exits the shell program)
help (displays all commands)

To run:

Download all files\n
Place them in an executable C environment\n
Change directory into build folder\n
