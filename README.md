SHELL WARS: The Return of the Shell
README

This is the Shell README! Congratulations you can read!

On this magical journey through the Shell you will experience various sensations
such as excessive euphoria, hallucinations, spatial reasoning, and the excessive need drink water.

To build this glorious Shell you must go into its cave also known as a build directory and execute a spell of such power that it
will knock your trousers off! This incantation of pure magic is the 'cmake ..', once this spell is cast you will be able to use something
called a 'make'. This will require you to buy a beer for the programmer, if you cannot buy said beer then it is required to make a small

If you cannot do either of these actions, I the programmer, ask that you at least spread word of this Shell and tell the tale
to a fair maiden gale. She resides at St. Mary's Church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the rapid whirlpool of Llantysilio of The Red Cave 
also know as Llanfairpwllgwyngyll

This Shell only responds to poking and prodding with the standard input commands.
These exotic commands come in such flavors as pwd, cd, ls, exit, grep, and cat. Please be aware that the Shell is not
at its final form. This means it cannot perform the very powerful spirit bomb pipe command. Treat the Shell with the utmost respect
and it shell treat you like what ever it damn well pleases (seriously, I can't contain this son of a b*tch).

Hey wanna know a fun thing to do with the Shell? Try executing a command over and over and over again!

All in all, this Shell is one fantastic little piece of shitty programming because you can assume that commands will be no larger
than 100 characters. Its also expected for you not to run the execute command over and over again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Ask the shell (verbatim):
If fuzzy wuzzy was a bear, would fuzzy wuzzy have no hair, or what if fuzzy wuzzy ate a pear?
